# Collection Roles Directory

This directory can be used to ship various roles inside an Ansible collection.
Each roles is placed in a folder that is named after the role name.

Each role should be conclusive and should be based on our
[skeleton role](https://github.com/whiletruedoio/ansible-skeleton/).

The documentation for the structure can be found
[here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_collections_structure.html#roles-directory).
