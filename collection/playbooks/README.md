# Collection Playbooks Directory

This directory can be used to ship various playbooks inside an Ansible
collection. Each playbook should be represented by a single yml/yaml file with
a conclusive name.

The documentation for the structure can be found
[here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_collections_structure.html#playbooks-directory).
